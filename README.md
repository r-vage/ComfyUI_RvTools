# ComfyUI_Eclipse

ComfyUI_Eclipse is a collection of custom nodes, helpers and utilities for ComfyUI designed to make workflow building easier and more reliable. It includes type conversions, folder and filename helpers, image/video utilities, logic and flow helpers, and a broad pipe ecosystem.

> #### ⚠️ Warning
> - Workflows created with RvTools_v2 are NOT compatible with this version. This release contains a substantial cleanup and many improvements.
> - <b>Version 4.0.0: all legacy/deprecated nodes have been completely removed from the codebase.</b>
>   - *Note on upgrading:* If your existing workflows fail to load due to the version tag removals, you can automatically migrate them (with backups) by using the built-in **[Workflow Migration Tool](Readme/workflow_migration.md)** node, running the command-line script `python tools/migrate_workflow.py <path_to_workflow_or_directory>`, or following the manual search-and-replace mapping guide in [migration_mapping.txt](tools/migration_mapping.txt).

## Beginner-friendly installation

The easiest way to install ComfyUI_Eclipse is to place it in ComfyUI's `custom_nodes` folder so ComfyUI will discover the nodes automatically.

1. Locate your ComfyUI installation folder.
2. Inside ComfyUI, find (or create) the `custom_nodes` folder.
3. Copy the entire `ComfyUI_Eclipse` folder into `custom_nodes` so the tree looks like:

```
ComfyUI/
  custom_nodes/
    ComfyUI_Eclipse/
      py/
      core/
      README.md
      ...
```

Or, clone directly into `custom_nodes`:

```powershell
# from your ComfyUI directory (PowerShell)
git clone https://github.com/r-vage/ComfyUI_Eclipse custom_nodes/ComfyUI_Eclipse
```

4. Install any optional Python dependencies required by specific nodes. From the repository root (or your ComfyUI root), run:

```powershell
# optional - only if your ComfyUI environment is missing packages from requirements.txt
pip install -r custom_nodes/ComfyUI_Eclipse/requirements.txt

# For ComfyUI portable installations:
python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r custom_nodes/ComfyUI_Eclipse/requirements.txt
```

Common dependencies referenced by nodes include: torch, numpy, Pillow, opencv-python, piexif and others. ComfyUI itself usually provides the main ML stack (torch, torchvision, safetensors), but if you see errors you may need to install missing packages.

5. Restart ComfyUI. The new nodes should appear in the node list under categories provided by the package.

### Eclipse Folder Structure and Default Extraction

On startup, ComfyUI_Eclipse extracts default files from the `.defaults/` folder
directly into the repository's own folders. This seeds first installs and also
introduces newly packaged files after an update. All user-editable files live
inside the repo itself:

```
custom_nodes/
  ComfyUI_Eclipse/
    prompts/                # Smart Prompt text files
      tag_lists/            # Ready-to-use Prompt Forge category/rating corpora
      environment/          # Environment descriptions
      settings/             # Style and quality settings
      subjects/             # Subject categories
    styles/                 # Prompt Styler style files (CSV/JSON)
    patterns/               # SmartTextProcessor pattern files
    wildcards/              # Example wildcard files
    config.json             # Private Eclipse settings
    .defaults/              # Git-tracked defaults (*.example files)
```

**Important Notes:**
- **Edit files directly in the repo folders** (for example, `ComfyUI_Eclipse/prompts/`).
- **Git updates won't overwrite your edits** — new defaults are extracted automatically; an updated default replaces its runtime copy only when that copy still matches the previously packaged hash. User-modified files and intentionally deleted known files remain untouched.
- **No `models/Eclipse` links or migration** — Eclipse reads prompts, styles, and patterns directly from the repository and leaves former `models/Eclipse/*` entries untouched.
- **Wildcard integration** — Eclipse creates `models/wildcards/smart_prompt` as a junction or symlink to its `prompts/` directory so the Wildcard node can use the same files without duplication. Startup keeps a correct link, repairs a wrong or dangling target on Windows and Linux, and never replaces a real directory.

### Opening a console / terminal in the ComfyUI folder (beginner)

If you're new to command lines, here's a very short guide to open a terminal (console) already located in your ComfyUI folder so you can run commands there.

Windows (PowerShell / Windows Terminal):

- Option A — From File Explorer:
  1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the ComfyUI installation folder (the folder that contains `run_nvidia_gpu.bat`, `webui.bat`, `main.py` or similar files).
  2. Hold Shift, right-click on an empty area in the folder and choose "Open PowerShell window here" or "Open in Windows Terminal".

- Option B — From any PowerShell window:
  1. Open PowerShell or Windows Terminal.
  2. Change directory to the ComfyUI folder, for example:

```powershell
# replace the path below with your actual ComfyUI path
cd 'D:\path\to\ComfyUI'
# or using Set-Location
Set-Location 'D:\path\to\ComfyUI'
```

Notes for Windows:
- If your path contains spaces, wrap it in single or double quotes.
- Your default shell may be PowerShell (`pwsh.exe`) or Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`); PowerShell and Windows Terminal are recommended.

macOS / Linux (Terminal):

1. Open Terminal (Spotlight → "Terminal" on macOS, or your terminal emulator on Linux).
2. Change directory to the ComfyUI folder, for example:

```bash
# replace the path below with your actual ComfyUI path
cd /home/you/ComfyUI
```

Tips:
- Use Tab to autocomplete long folder names.
- If you use a Python virtual environment, activate it from the same console before running ComfyUI.

## External model providers

The former Eclipse diffusion loaders, LoRA Stack, Nunchaku PuLID nodes, and the Download Manager are provided by [ComfyUI Smart Model Loader](https://github.com/r-vage/ComfyUI_SmartModelLoader). Smart LM Loader, Smart Detection, Detection to Bboxes, the Registry Manager, and the `/smartlml` API are provided by [ComfyUI SmartLLM](https://github.com/r-vage/ComfyUI_SmartLLM). Install the corresponding pack to keep existing workflows resolving the unchanged `[Eclipse]` node IDs. Eclipse integrations such as Get First/Last Image, preview culling, and seed interoperability remain compatible with the external providers.

The three packs have independent settings and private configuration ownership. Eclipse controls remain under **Eclipse → General** and **Eclipse → Nodes 2.0**; the diffusion pack uses **Smart Model Loader → General**; and `ComfyUI_SmartLLM` uses **Smart LM Loader → Configuration**. Each category talks only to its own REST namespace and config file, so installation or extension load order does not merge log levels, retry policies, credentials, sliders, or pack-specific options.

## Tips & troubleshooting

- If a node raises an import error for a package, install the missing package into the same Python environment that runs ComfyUI.
- If you place the folder under `custom_nodes` but the nodes don't show up, restart ComfyUI and check the server logs for import errors.

## Smart LM and detection integration

[ComfyUI SmartLLM](https://github.com/r-vage/ComfyUI_SmartLLM) now owns Smart LM Loader, Smart Detection, Detection to Bboxes, all native and container backends, the Registry Manager, installation guides, and security documentation. The node IDs and display names still carry their `[Eclipse]` suffix so saved workflows remain compatible. Eclipse continues to consume their outputs through its remaining image-selection, preview, and seed-integration nodes.

## The Pipe Ecosystem of [Eclipse]

The pipe ecosystem in ComfyUI_Eclipse is a sophisticated data interchange system designed to standardize and simplify the flow of complex data structures through ComfyUI workflows. Pipes act as containers that bundle related parameters, models, and settings into single, manageable objects, eliminating the need for dozens of individual node connections.

### Core Concept

A pipe is fundamentally a Python dictionary that encapsulates multiple related pieces of data. Instead of connecting separate wires for model, CLIP, VAE, latent tensor, dimensions, sampler settings, and metadata, all of this information can be passed through a single pipe connection. This approach dramatically reduces workflow complexity and improves maintainability.

### Pipe Types and Variants

#### Context Pipes
Context pipes are the foundation of the ecosystem, holding the core components of a generation pipeline:

- **Context (Image) (`Context (Image) [Eclipse]`):** Standard image generation context containing model, CLIP, VAE, conditioning (positive/negative), latent, sampler/scheduler, generation parameters (steps, cfg, seed, dimensions), and text prompts. Ideal for standard image generation workflows.
- **Context (Video) (`Context (Video) [Eclipse]`):** Extended context for video workflows, adding video-specific parameters like frame rate, frame load cap, skip frames, select every nth frame, and audio/image inputs/outputs. Designed for video generation pipelines.
- **Context (WanVideo) (`Context (WanVideo) [Eclipse]`):** Specialized wrapper for WAN Video Workflows, supporting WANVIDEOMODEL and WANTEXTENCODER types with additional video processing parameters for WAN-based video generation.

#### Generation Data Pipes
These pipes focus on sampler and generation settings:

- **Generation Data (`Generation Data [Eclipse]`):** Contains sampler/scheduler names, steps, cfg, seed, dimensions, text prompts, model/VAE names, LoRA names, denoise strength, and CLIP skip settings. Perfect for metadata tracking and parameter preservation.

#### Sampler Settings Pipes
Specialized pipes for different sampling configurations:

- **Sampler Settings (`Sampler Settings [Eclipse]`):** Comprehensive sampler configuration with sampler/scheduler, steps, CFG, seed, and denoise parameters.
- **Sampler Settings (Small) (`Sampler Settings (Small) [Eclipse]`):** Minimal sampler configuration with basic sampler/scheduler, steps, and CFG.
- **Sampler Settings (Small+Seed) (`Sampler Settings (Small+Seed) [Eclipse]`):** Minimal configuration with added seed control.
- **Sampler Settings (Seed) (`Sampler Settings (Seed) [Eclipse]`):** Full sampler settings with integrated seed management.
- **Sampler Settings (NI) (`Sampler Settings (NI) [Eclipse]`):** Noise Injection Parameters with generation settings (no seed).
- **Sampler Settings (NI+Seed) (`Sampler Settings (NI+Seed) [Eclipse]`):** Noise Injection Parameters with seed and generation settings.

#### Multi-Channel Pipes
Flexible any-type data pipes for custom workflows:

- **Pipe 12CH Any (`Pipe 12CH Any [Eclipse]`):** 12-channel any-type pipe for complex custom workflows requiring multiple arbitrary data streams.

### Key Abilities

#### 1. Standardized Data Interchange
- **Dict-Style Format:** All pipes use consistent dictionary structures with canonical key names.
- **Type Safety:** Each pipe component has defined types (MODEL, CLIP, VAE, LATENT, INT, FLOAT, STRING, etc.).
- **Extensibility:** New fields can be added without breaking existing workflows.

#### 2. Workflow Simplification
- **Reduced Connections:** Bundle 10+ parameters into single connections.
- **Cleaner Layouts:** Workflows become more readable and easier to debug.
- **Modular Design:** Components can be mixed and matched across different pipeline types.

#### 3. Data Manipulation Capabilities
- **Pipe Concatenation:** Merge multiple pipes using the Concat Multi node with strategies (overwrite, preserve, merge).
- **Component Extraction:** Extract individual elements (model, CLIP, VAE, latent) from pipes using Pipe Out nodes.
- **Context Building:** Construct pipes from scratch or modify existing ones.

#### 4. Advanced Features
- **Latent Generation:** Automatic latent tensor creation based on dimensions and batch size.
- **Metadata Preservation:** Maintain model names, VAE names, LoRA lists for reference.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks and validation for missing or invalid data.
- **Memory Optimization:** Support for different weight dtypes and CLIP trimming.

### Pipe Output Nodes

Specialized nodes extract specific data from pipes:

- **Pipe Out Smart Folder (`Pipe Out Smart Folder [Eclipse]`):** Extracts smart folder configuration including paths, dimensions, and placeholder data.
- **Pipe Out WanVideo Setup (`Pipe Out WanVideo Setup [Eclipse]`):** Extracts WanVideo workflow setup parameters.

### Practical Applications

#### Complex Workflows
Pipes excel in workflows requiring multiple model components, ensemble CLIP setups, or video processing pipelines where managing dozens of individual connections becomes impractical.

#### Batch Processing
When processing multiple images or videos with consistent settings, pipes allow settings to be defined once and reused across batch operations.

#### Modular Pipeline Construction
Build reusable pipeline segments that can be connected together, with pipes handling the data flow between modules.

#### Memory Management
Pipes support efficient memory usage through dtype control and component lazy loading.

### Best Practices

- **Use Dict Pipes:** Prefer dict-style pipes over legacy tuple formats for maximum compatibility.
- **Validate Components:** Use pipe output nodes to ensure all required components are present.
- **Merge Strategically:** When concatenating pipes, choose appropriate merge strategies (merge for combining, overwrite for replacement).
- **Type Consistency:** Ensure pipe components match expected types for downstream nodes.
- **Documentation:** Include pipe metadata (model names, settings) for workflow reproducibility.

The pipe ecosystem transforms ComfyUI workflow construction from a web of individual connections into a streamlined, professional data flow system capable of handling the most complex AI generation pipelines.
