## Beginner-friendly installation

The easiest way to install ComfyUI-RvTools is to place it in ComfyUI's `custom_nodes` folder so ComfyUI will discover the nodes automatically.

1. Locate your ComfyUI installation folder.
2. Inside ComfyUI, find (or create) the `custom_nodes` folder.
3. Copy the entire `ComfyUI_RvTools` folder into `custom_nodes` so the tree looks like:

```
ComfyUI/
  custom_nodes/
    ComfyUI_RvTools/
      py/
      core/
      README.md
      ...
```

Or, clone directly into `custom_nodes`:

```powershell
# from your ComfyUI directory (PowerShell)
git clone https://github.com/r-vage/ComfyUI_RvTools custom_nodes/ComfyUI_RvTools
```

4. Install any optional Python dependencies required by specific nodes. From the repository root (or your ComfyUI root), run:

```powershell
# optional - only if your ComfyUI environment is missing packages from requirements.txt
pip install -r custom_nodes/ComfyUI_RvTools/requirements.txt

# For ComfyUI portable installations:
python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r custom_nodes/ComfyUI_RvTools/requirements.txt
```

Common dependencies referenced by nodes include: torch, numpy, Pillow, opencv-python, piexif and others. ComfyUI itself usually provides the main ML stack (torch, torchvision, safetensors), but if you see errors you may need to install missing packages.

5. Restart ComfyUI. The new nodes should appear in the node list under categories provided by the package.

### Opening a console / terminal in the ComfyUI folder (beginner)

If you're new to command lines, here's a very short guide to open a terminal (console) already located in your ComfyUI folder so you can run commands there.

Windows (PowerShell / Windows Terminal):

- Option A — From File Explorer:
  1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the ComfyUI installation folder (the folder that contains `run_nvidia_gpu.bat`, `webui.bat`, `main.py` or similar files).
  2. Hold Shift, right-click on an empty area in the folder and choose "Open PowerShell window here" or "Open in Windows Terminal".

- Option B — From any PowerShell window:
  1. Open PowerShell or Windows Terminal.
  2. Change directory to the ComfyUI folder, for example:

```powershell
# replace the path below with your actual ComfyUI path
cd 'D:\path\to\ComfyUI'
# or using Set-Location
Set-Location 'D:\path\to\ComfyUI'
```

Notes for Windows:
- If your path contains spaces, wrap it in single or double quotes.
- Your default shell may be PowerShell (`pwsh.exe`) or Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`); PowerShell and Windows Terminal are recommended.

macOS / Linux (Terminal):

1. Open Terminal (Spotlight → "Terminal" on macOS, or your terminal emulator on Linux).
2. Change directory to the ComfyUI folder, for example:

```bash
# replace the path below with your actual ComfyUI path
cd /home/you/ComfyUI
```

Tips:
- Use Tab to autocomplete long folder names.
- If you use a Python virtual environment, activate it from the same console before running ComfyUI.

## Quick start — using the Smart Loaders

The Smart Loader series provides modern, flexible model loading with support for multiple formats and quantization methods.

### Smart Loader Plus [RvTools]
The full-featured loader for complex workflows:

- **Multi-Format Support:** Standard Checkpoints, UNet models, Nunchaku quantized Flux/Qwen (SVDQuant INT4/FP4/FP8), and GGUF quantized models.
- **Template System:** Save and load complete configurations including model selections, CLIP/VAE settings, and sampler parameters.
- **CLIP Ensemble:** Support for up to 4 CLIP modules with multiple architecture types (Flux, SD3, SDXL, Qwen, HiDream, Hunyuan, Wan, etc.).
- **Advanced Configuration:** 
  - Latent configuration with resolution presets or custom dimensions
  - Sampler settings (sampler, scheduler, steps, CFG, flux_guidance)
  - CLIP layer trimming for memory optimization
  - Weight dtype control (fp8 variants)
- **Quantization Options:**
  - Nunchaku Flux: Data type, cache threshold, attention mode, CPU offload
  - Nunchaku Qwen: GPU block allocation, pinned memory
  - GGUF: Dequantization dtype, patch dtype, device placement
- **Outputs:** Single pipe containing model, CLIP, VAE, latent, dimensions, batch size, sampler settings, and metadata.

### Smart Loader [RvTools]
Simplified loader for streamlined workflows:

- **Same Format Support:** Standard Checkpoints, UNet, Nunchaku Flux/Qwen, GGUF models.
- **Template Compatibility:** Load templates from Smart Loader Plus (latent/sampler settings ignored gracefully).
- **Minimal Configuration:** Focus on model/CLIP/VAE loading only.
- **No Latent/Sampler:** Use separate nodes for Empty Latent Image and KSampler configuration.
- **Outputs:** Pipe containing model, CLIP, VAE, model name, and metadata.

### Required Extensions for Quantized Models

To use Nunchaku or GGUF quantized models with the Smart Loaders, you need to install the following ComfyUI extensions:

**For Nunchaku Support (SVDQuant INT4/FP4/FP8):**
- Repository: [ComfyUI-Nunchaku](https://github.com/nunchaku-tech/ComfyUI-nunchaku)
- Installation: Clone into your `custom_nodes` folder
- Supports: Nunchaku Flux and Nunchaku Qwen quantized models

**For GGUF Support:**
- Repository: [ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF)
- Installation: Clone into your `custom_nodes` folder
- Supports: GGUF quantized model formats

```powershell
# Navigate to your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes

# Install Nunchaku support
git clone https://github.com/nunchaku-tech/ComfyUI-nunchaku

# Install GGUF support
git clone https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF
```

**Note:** The Smart Loaders will work without these extensions installed, but quantized model options will be disabled. Standard Checkpoints and UNet models work without additional dependencies.

Basic usage:

1. Add Smart Loader or Smart Loader Plus to your workflow.
2. Select model type (Standard Checkpoint, UNet, Nunchaku Flux, Nunchaku Qwen, or GGUF).
3. Choose the appropriate model file from the dropdown.
4. Configure CLIP (baked or external) and VAE (baked or external).
5. For Smart Loader Plus: Set resolution, batch size, and sampler settings.
6. Use templates to save/load configurations for quick workflow iteration.
7. Connect the pipe output to downstream nodes or use Pipe Out nodes to extract components.

The Smart Loaders include comprehensive error handling, automatic VRAM cleanup, and graceful fallbacks when optional extensions (Nunchaku, GGUF) are not installed.

## Tips & troubleshooting

- If a node raises an import error for a package, install the missing package into the same Python environment that runs ComfyUI.
- If you place the folder under `custom_nodes` but the nodes don't show up, restart ComfyUI and check the server logs for import errors.

### Placeholder System
The node supports placeholders in both output paths and filename prefixes for dynamic value insertion. Placeholders are replaced with actual values at save time; unknown or empty placeholders default to readable alternatives.

Supported placeholders:
- `%today`, `%date` — Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `%time` — Current time (HHMMSS)
- `%Y`, `%m`, `%d`, `%H`, `%S` — Individual date/time components
- `%basemodel`, `%model` — Model names (base model and full model)
- `%seed`, `%sampler_name`, `%scheduler`, `%steps`, `%cfg`, `%denoise`, `%clip_skip` — Generation parameters

Example: `%today\%basemodel\%seed_%sampler_name_%steps` creates organized folder structures like `2025-09-27\ModelName\12345_euler_20`.

### Connection Possibilities
- **Direct Image Input:** Connect any image output to the `images` input for standard saving scenarios.
- **Pipe Input:** Connect a metadata pipe (from context or logic nodes) to `pipe_opt` to save images and extract metadata from complex workflows automatically.

Users can easily create custom prompt libraries:

1. **Navigate to the `prompt/` directory** in the ComfyUI_RvTools installation
2. **Choose or create a subfolder** (e.g., `subjects/`, `settings/`, or create your own like `styles/`)
3. **Create a numbered text file** (e.g., `1_my_prompts.txt`, `2_lighting_styles.txt`)
4. **Add one option per line:**
   ```
   dramatic lighting
   soft natural light
   golden hour glow
   studio lighting
   moody shadows
   ```
5. **Save the file** and the node will automatically detect it on next load

**Naming Convention:**
- Start with a number for ordering: `1_`, `2_`, `3_`, etc.
- Follow with a descriptive name: `character`, `pose`, `lighting`, etc.
- Use `.txt` extension
- Example: `1_character.txt`, `2_pose.txt`, `3_clothing.txt`

### Use Cases

**Rapid Prompt Iteration:**
Build complex prompts quickly by selecting from curated options rather than typing repeatedly.

**A/B Testing:**
Easily swap between different prompt components to test variations systematically.

**Team Collaboration:**
Share prompt libraries across teams by distributing text files with standardized options.

**Workflow Templates:**
Create reusable prompt structures for specific art styles, subjects, or generation types.

**Learning Tool:**
Explore effective prompting by browsing pre-configured options and understanding what works.

### Best Practices

- **Organize by Category:** Keep related prompts in the same subfolder for easier navigation
- **Use Clear Names:** Name files descriptively so widgets are self-explanatory
- **One Concept Per Line:** Each line should represent a complete, coherent prompt element
- **Number for Order:** Use file numbering to control the logical flow of prompt building
- **Document Libraries:** Consider adding a `_desc` version of files with explanations
- **Seed Everything:** Always use seed control when using Random selections for reproducible results

The Smart Prompt node transforms prompt engineering from manual typing to curated selection, dramatically speeding up workflow iteration and experimentation.

## Node Spotlight: Wildcard Processor [RvTools]

The **Wildcard Processor** node is a powerful prompt expansion system that enables dynamic, randomized prompt generation through template-based wildcards, supporting nested expansions, weighted selections, and advanced pattern matching for infinite prompt variations.

### Outstanding Abilities

#### Wildcard Syntax & Expansion
- **Basic Wildcards:** Use `{wildcard_name}` syntax to insert random selections from wildcard files
- **Nested Wildcards:** Wildcards can contain other wildcards for complex, layered expansions
- **Multiple Wildcards:** Use multiple wildcards in a single prompt for combinatorial variations
- **Inline Options:** Define options directly in prompts using `{option1|option2|option3}` syntax
- **File-Based Wildcards:** Load wildcard options from `.txt` files in the `ComfyUI/models/wildcards/` directory

#### Weighted Selection System
- **Weight Syntax:** Assign probability weights using `option:weight` format
- **Flexible Weighting:** Higher weights increase selection probability (e.g., `red:5` is 5x more likely than `blue:1`)
- **Mixed Weighting:** Combine weighted and unweighted options (unweighted defaults to weight of 1)
- **Normalized Distribution:** Weights are automatically normalized to create proper probability distributions

**Example weighted wildcard file (`colors.txt`):**
```
red:5
blue:3
green:2
yellow:1
```

#### Wildcard File Management
- **Custom Wildcards:** Create `.txt` files in the `ComfyUI/models/wildcards/` directory
- **One Option Per Line:** Each line represents one possible expansion
- **Automatic Discovery:** New wildcard files are automatically detected
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Use subfolders to organize wildcards by category
- **File Naming:** Wildcard filename (without .txt) becomes the wildcard name
- **Example Files:** Example wildcards are automatically copied to the directory on first launch

**Creating a wildcard file:**
1. Navigate to `ComfyUI/models/wildcards/` directory
2. Create a text file (e.g., `emotions.txt`)
3. Add one option per line:
   ```
   happy:3
   sad:2
   excited
   calm
   mysterious:4
   ```
4. Use in prompts as `{emotions}`

#### Seed Control & Reproducibility
- **Deterministic Randomization:** Same seed always produces same expansion
- **Seed Input Port:** Optional seed input for dynamic seed control from workflow
- **Dynamic Seed Widget:** Seed widget appears/updates when seed_input is connected
- **Workflow Integration:** Ensures reproducible prompt variations across generations

#### Advanced Pattern Matching
- **Recursive Expansion:** Wildcards are expanded recursively until no wildcards remain
- **Escape Sequences:** Support for escaping special characters when needed
- **Multiple Passes:** Continues expansion until all nested wildcards are resolved
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback for missing or invalid wildcard files

#### Prompt Output
- **Expanded Prompt:** Returns fully expanded prompt with all wildcards replaced
- **Clean Output:** Removes extra spaces, normalizes formatting
- **Reproducible:** Identical seed + template = identical output

### Wildcard Syntax Examples

**Basic Wildcard:**
```
A {color} {animal} in a {location}
```
With `color.txt`, `animal.txt`, `location.txt` files in wildcards directory.

**Inline Options:**
```
A {red|blue|green} car driving through {city|forest|desert}
```

**Weighted Inline Options:**
```
{portrait:5|landscape:2|abstract:1} painting of {cats:3|dogs:2|birds}
```

**Nested Wildcards:**
```
{art_style} artwork featuring {subject}
```
Where `art_style.txt` might contain `{modern|classical} {painting|sketch}`.

**Complex Combination:**
```
{quality:10|} {art_style}, {subject} {pose:3|}, {lighting}, {background:2|}
```
Combines weighted selections, optional elements (empty string), and multiple wildcards.

### Creating Custom Wildcard Libraries

**Simple Wildcard (`styles.txt`):**
```
photorealistic
anime style
oil painting
watercolor
digital art
sketch
```

**Weighted Wildcard (`quality.txt`):**
```
masterpiece:10
best quality:8
high quality:5
normal quality:2
low quality:1
```

**Nested Wildcard (`character.txt`):**
```
{male|female} {human|elf|dwarf}
{young|old} {warrior|mage|rogue}
mysterious {hero|villain}
```

### Use Cases

**Infinite Variation:**
Generate endless unique prompts from template structures for large batch generation.

**Dataset Creation:**
Create diverse training datasets by generating thousands of unique prompts automatically.

**Exploration & Discovery:**
Discover unexpected prompt combinations by letting wildcards randomly combine elements.

**Style Experimentation:**
Test different art styles, subjects, and compositions systematically with controlled randomization.

**Batch Processing:**
Generate varied images in batch workflows while maintaining structural consistency.

### Best Practices

- **Start Simple:** Begin with basic wildcards before moving to nested/weighted versions
- **Use Weights Wisely:** Weight your most desired outcomes higher for better results
- **Organize Categories:** Keep related wildcards in separate files for maintainability
- **Test Templates:** Test wildcard templates with multiple seeds to ensure good variation
- **Document Wildcards:** Consider naming conventions that make wildcard purpose clear
- **Combine with Smart Prompt:** Use both nodes together - Smart Prompt for structure, Wildcards for variation
- **Seed Control is Critical:** Always use seed management for reproducible or iteratable results

The Wildcard Processor transforms static prompts into dynamic templates, enabling systematic exploration of prompt space and effortless generation of diverse, reproducible variations.

## The Pipe Ecosystem of [RvTools]

The pipe ecosystem in ComfyUI-RvTools is a sophisticated data interchange system designed to standardize and simplify the flow of complex data structures through ComfyUI workflows. Pipes act as containers that bundle related parameters, models, and settings into single, manageable objects, eliminating the need for dozens of individual node connections.

### Core Concept

A pipe is fundamentally a Python dictionary that encapsulates multiple related pieces of data. Instead of connecting separate wires for model, CLIP, VAE, latent tensor, dimensions, sampler settings, and metadata, all of this information can be passed through a single pipe connection. This approach dramatically reduces workflow complexity and improves maintainability.

### Pipe Types and Variants

#### Context Pipes
Context pipes are the foundation of the ecosystem, holding the core components of a generation pipeline:

- **Context (Image) (`Context (Image) [RvTools]`):** Standard image generation context containing model, CLIP, VAE, conditioning (positive/negative), latent, sampler/scheduler, generation parameters (steps, cfg, seed, dimensions), and text prompts. Ideal for standard image generation workflows.
- **Context (Video) (`Context (Video) [RvTools]`):** Extended context for video workflows, adding video-specific parameters like frame rate, frame load cap, skip frames, select every nth frame, and audio/image inputs/outputs. Designed for video generation pipelines.
- **Context (WanVideo) (`Context (WanVideo) [RvTools]`):** Specialized wrapper for WAN Video Workflows, supporting WANVIDEOMODEL and WANTEXTENCODER types with additional video processing parameters for WAN-based video generation.

#### Generation Data Pipes
These pipes focus on sampler and generation settings:

- **Generation Data (`Generation Data [RvTools]`):** Contains sampler/scheduler names, steps, cfg, seed, dimensions, text prompts, model/VAE names, LoRA names, denoise strength, and CLIP skip settings. Perfect for metadata tracking and parameter preservation.

#### Sampler Settings Pipes
Specialized pipes for different sampling configurations:

- **Sampler Settings (`Sampler Settings [RvTools]`):** Comprehensive sampler configuration with sampler/scheduler, steps, CFG, seed, and denoise parameters.
- **Sampler Settings (Small) (`Sampler Settings (Small) [RvTools]`):** Minimal sampler configuration with basic sampler/scheduler, steps, and CFG.
- **Sampler Settings (Small+Seed) (`Sampler Settings (Small+Seed) [RvTools]`):** Minimal configuration with added seed control.
- **Sampler Settings (Seed) (`Sampler Settings (Seed) [RvTools]`):** Full sampler settings with integrated seed management.
- **Sampler Settings (NI) (`Sampler Settings (NI) [RvTools]`):** Noise Injection Parameters with generation settings (no seed).
- **Sampler Settings (NI+Seed) (`Sampler Settings (NI+Seed) [RvTools]`):** Noise Injection Parameters with seed and generation settings.

#### Multi-Channel Pipes
Flexible any-type data pipes for custom workflows:

- **Pipe 12CH Any (`Pipe 12CH Any [RvTools]`):** 12-channel any-type pipe for complex custom workflows requiring multiple arbitrary data streams.

### Key Abilities

#### 1. Standardized Data Interchange
- **Dict-Style Format:** All pipes use consistent dictionary structures with canonical key names.
- **Type Safety:** Each pipe component has defined types (MODEL, CLIP, VAE, LATENT, INT, FLOAT, STRING, etc.).
- **Extensibility:** New fields can be added without breaking existing workflows.

#### 2. Workflow Simplification
- **Reduced Connections:** Bundle 10+ parameters into single connections.
- **Cleaner Layouts:** Workflows become more readable and easier to debug.
- **Modular Design:** Components can be mixed and matched across different pipeline types.

#### 3. Data Manipulation Capabilities
- **Pipe Concatenation:** Merge multiple pipes using the Concat Multi node with strategies (overwrite, preserve, merge).
- **Component Extraction:** Extract individual elements (model, CLIP, VAE, latent) from pipes using Pipe Out nodes.
- **Context Building:** Construct pipes from scratch or modify existing ones.

#### 4. Advanced Features
- **Latent Generation:** Automatic latent tensor creation based on dimensions and batch size.
- **Metadata Preservation:** Maintain model names, VAE names, LoRA lists for reference.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks and validation for missing or invalid data.
- **Memory Optimization:** Support for different weight dtypes and CLIP trimming.

### Pipe Output Nodes

Specialized nodes extract specific data from pipes:

- **Pipe Out Checkpoint Loader (`Pipe Out Checkpoint Loader [RvTools]`):** Extracts model, CLIP, VAE, latent, dimensions, batch size, and model/VAE names from checkpoint loader pipes.
- **Pipe Out Smart Folder (`Pipe Out Smart Folder [RvTools]`):** Extracts smart folder configuration including paths, dimensions, and placeholder data.
- **Pipe Out Sampler Settings (`Pipe Out Sampler Settings [RvTools]`):** Extracts all sampler and generation parameters (sampler, scheduler, steps, CFG, seed, denoise, etc.).
- **Pipe Out Load Directory Settings (`Pipe Out Load Directory Settings [RvTools]`):** Extracts directory settings for output path management.
- **Pipe Out Load Image (`Pipe Out Load Image [RvTools]`):** Extracts image data and associated metadata from image loading pipes.
- **Pipe Out VCNameGen (`Pipe Out VCNameGen [RvTools]`):** Extracts video/checkpoint name generator configuration.
- **Pipe Out WanVideo Setup (`Pipe Out WanVideo Setup [RvTools]`):** Extracts WanVideo workflow setup parameters.

### Practical Applications

#### Complex Workflows
Pipes excel in workflows requiring multiple model components, ensemble CLIP setups, or video processing pipelines where managing dozens of individual connections becomes impractical.

#### Batch Processing
When processing multiple images or videos with consistent settings, pipes allow settings to be defined once and reused across batch operations.

#### Modular Pipeline Construction
Build reusable pipeline segments that can be connected together, with pipes handling the data flow between modules.

#### Memory Management
Pipes support efficient memory usage through dtype control and component lazy loading.

### Best Practices

- **Use Dict Pipes:** Prefer dict-style pipes over legacy tuple formats for maximum compatibility.
- **Validate Components:** Use pipe output nodes to ensure all required components are present.
- **Merge Strategically:** When concatenating pipes, choose appropriate merge strategies (merge for combining, overwrite for replacement).
- **Type Consistency:** Ensure pipe components match expected types for downstream nodes.
- **Documentation:** Include pipe metadata (model names, settings) for workflow reproducibility.

The pipe ecosystem transforms ComfyUI workflow construction from a web of individual connections into a streamlined, professional data flow system capable of handling the most complex AI generation pipelines.
