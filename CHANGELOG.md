# Changelog

All notable changes to ComfyUI Eclipse are documented in this file.

Entries follow conventional commit prefixes:

## 2026-09-10

### Version: 4.3.33

- **Fix**
  - **Multiline list prefix:** Prepend the connected optional input to every non-empty list item while keeping the full string output unchanged.
  - **Root folder separators:** Treat forward slashes, backslashes, and mixed separators as the same nested relative path in Folder Path and both Smart Folder modes.
  - **Join list and batch inputs:** Process all connected lists and image batches in one execution so shorter inputs are not repeated by ComfyUI list mapping, and emit one ordered image batch for preview and downstream nodes.
- **Docs**
  - **Smart Folder paths:** Document cross-platform separator support for nested root folders.

**Changed files:**
- `core/path_helpers.py` (new)
- `py/RvConversion_Join.py`
- `py/RvFolder_FolderPath.py`
- `py/RvFolder_SmartFolder.py`
- `py/RvText_Multiline_List.py`
- `Readme/Smart_Folder.md`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-08

### Version: 4.3.32

- **Feat**
  - **Scrollable Markdown Note:** Add an Eclipse-owned, frontend-only workflow annotation with sanitized Markdown preview, double-click editing, and a resize-constrained scrollbar in both renderers.
- **Docs**
  - **Markdown annotation:** Document the Markdown Note in the Text node overview.

**Changed files:**
- `py/RvText_MarkdownNote.py` (new)
- `js/eclipse-markdown-note.js` (new)
- `README.md`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-08

### Version: 4.3.31

- **Feat**
  - **Local self-update:** Show the running Eclipse version in its ComfyUI settings and provide a loopback-only, explicitly confirmed update action that replaces tracked files with official `main`, preserves untracked user data, installs requirements, and reports the required restart.
- **Fix**
  - **Retired source cleanup:** Before custom-node imports, deactivate Python and JavaScript files that Eclipse shipped historically but no longer ships by moving exact inventoried paths to non-loadable `.bak` files. Preserve modified current sources and unlisted fork files while preventing overlay updates from loading obsolete nodes or frontend extensions.
- **Docs**
  - **Recoverable startup cleanup:** Document the retired-file inventory, backup suffix, and server-log report.

**Changed files:**
- `.eclipse-retired-sources.json` (new)
- `prestartup_script.py` (new)
- `core/self_update.py` (new)
- `core/server_endpoints.py`
- `js/eclipse-self-update.js` (new)
- `README.md`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-08

### Version: 4.3.30

- **Feat**
  - **Join audio timelines:** Append any number of AUDIO inputs in connection order so consecutive video segments retain audio throughout when the joined track is sent to either Eclipse Save Video node. Resample differing rates to the highest input rate and expand mono clips to match multi-channel inputs.
- **Docs**
  - **Sequential versus overlaid audio:** Clarify that Eclipse Join concatenates audio along time, while ComfyUI Merge Audio overlays tracks from the start.

**Changed files:**
- `py/RvConversion_Join.py`
- `Readme/Utility_Nodes.md`
- `README.md`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-07

### Version: 4.3.29

- **Feat**
  - **Smart Folder video groups:** Split VHS loading, Loop, Context, and optional Duration metadata into independent chips with conditional pipe keys, while keeping frame rate always available in Video mode and appending duration to compatible pipe interfaces.
  - **Shared aligned resolution:** Let the Image Size chip control resolution in both modes, omit disabled dimensions, and align custom sizes with a configurable 1–512 divisor across typed, button, keyboard, and scrub changes.
- **Fix**
  - **Smart Folder workflow compatibility:** Migrate legacy widget layouts before configuration so existing video fields remain enabled, cosmetic widget variants and unknown trailing values retain their positions, and repeated loads remain stable.
- **Docs**
  - **Smart Folder controls:** Document group ownership, dependencies, conditional pipe fields, custom dimension alignment, and duration metadata.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-smart-folder.js`
- `js/eclipse-smart-folder-workflow-migration.js`
- `py/RvFolder_SmartFolder.py`
- `py/RvPipe_Out_SmartFolder.py`
- `py/RvPipe_IO_Context_Video.py`
- `py/RvPipe_IO_Context_WanVideoWrapper.py`
- `Readme/Smart_Folder.md`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-07

### Version: 4.3.28

- **Feat**
  - **Load Image picker thumbnails:** Add a read-only endpoint that produces EXIF-corrected, aspect-preserving static WebP thumbnails for supported input and output images while retaining original animated files for selection previews and execution.
- **Perf**
  - **Shared virtualized preview cache:** Load only visible picker thumbnails, coalesce requests across both Load Image variants, adapt uncropped grid geometry to thumbnail aspect ratios, and revoke or invalidate object URLs on failure, deletion, refresh, and page unload.

**Changed files:**
- `core/server_endpoints.py`
- `js/eclipse-image-browser.js`
- `js/eclipse-load-image.js`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-05

### Version: 4.3.27

- **Feat**
  - **Dataset download workers:** Expose the Hugging Face concurrent-file worker count as an editable setting inside both Linux and Windows launchers so users no longer need a separate environment command.
- **Docs**
  - **Downloader tuning:** Document the in-script worker setting for both platforms while retaining the optional environment override for retry limits.

**Changed files:**
- `scripts/download_hf_dataset.sh`
- `scripts/download_hf_dataset.bat`
- `Readme/HuggingFace_Dataset_Downloader.md`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-05

### Version: 4.3.26

- **Feat**
  - **Hugging Face dataset snapshots:** Add configurable Linux and Windows utilities that download complete dataset repositories into an exact target folder, normalize repository IDs and dataset URLs, reuse cached content, expose optional token and Python-interpreter settings, discover common ComfyUI Python environments, offer to install the constrained Hub dependency when it is missing, and automatically honor API rate-limit windows without emitting tracebacks.
- **Fix**
  - **Folder batch automatic stop:** Disarm Run Instant, Run on Change, and legacy Auto Queue when the stepped folder loader reports that no frames remain, without interrupting active work or removing manually queued jobs. Reuse the same current-frontend handling for single-image folder iteration.
- **Docs**
  - **Dataset downloader guide:** Document configuration, explicit interpreter selection, secure token handling, execution, target layout, dependency installation, automatic rate-limit retries, concurrency controls, and safe reruns.
  - **Folder batch exhaustion:** Clarify that automatic continuation stops only after the stepped range is exhausted, while a final partial batch remains valid.

**Changed files:**
- `scripts/download_hf_dataset.sh`
- `scripts/download_hf_dataset.bat`
- `scripts/download_hf_dataset.py`
- `Readme/HuggingFace_Dataset_Downloader.md`
- `README.md`
- `requirements.txt`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `js/eclipse-queue-control-utils.js`
- `js/eclipse-load-batch-from-folder-step-advanced.js`
- `js/eclipse-load-image-folder.js`
- `Readme/Batch_Selection_Slice_Dice.md`

## 2026-09-05

### Version: 4.3.25

- **Feat**
  - **Image Selector unattended mode:** Add a custom `Auto select and confirm` toolbar checkbox that immediately fills the displayed selection so only Confirm is needed, then selects every future incoming image and continues without pausing. Disabling it clears the automatic decision without interrupting the active queue so the next execution returns to manual review.
- **Fix**
  - **Folder-step exhausted ranges:** Replace traceback-producing errors for `batch_index` selections beyond the available frames with an explanatory warning toast and a silent downstream execution block. Apply the same behavior when a video's frame count is unavailable until after decoding.
  - **Save Prompt batch alignment:** Preserve caption-to-filename ordering from folder loaders, Image Selector, and IO Slice & Dice; broadcast singleton inputs, reject incompatible list lengths before writing, and apply duplicate filenames according to each save mode.
  - **Save Prompt persistence and paths:** Propagate save failures, preserve malformed JSON instead of replacing it, use atomic locked JSON updates, allow intentional source-relative parent traversal, and contain ordinary relative paths within the ComfyUI output directory.
- **Refactor**
  - **Save Prompt batch appends:** Serialize complete cached TXT and CSV writes and guard reused handles against stale auto-close timers.
- **Docs**
  - **Image Selector automation:** Document unattended folder-batch selection and the discard-like behavior when automatic selection is disabled.
  - **Save Prompt workflows:** Document multi-caption append behavior, filename-provider alignment, and the I2PSave sibling prompts-folder configuration.

**Changed files:**
- `py/RvImage_Selector.py`
- `js/eclipse-image-selector.js`
- `Readme/Batch_Selection_Slice_Dice.md`
- `py/RvImage_LoadBatchFromFolderStepAdvanced.py`
- `js/eclipse-load-batch-from-folder-step-advanced.js`
- `py/RvText_SavePrompt.py`
- `Readme/Save_Prompt.md`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-04

### Version: 4.3.24

- **Fix**
  - **Video save filenames:** Align both Eclipse video save nodes with image-style output names by using a four-digit counter without a trailing underscore, while continuing counters across existing legacy video filenames.
  - **Inset & Crop image lists:** Crop heterogeneous-size image lists without concatenating their tensors, preserving each cropped image at its own dimensions while retaining batched output for batch inputs.

**Changed files:**
- `py/RvVideo_Save.py`
- `py/RvVideo_SaveData.py`
- `py/RvImage_InsetCrop.py`
- `Readme/Save_Video_Data.md`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-03

### Version: 4.3.23

- **Fix**
  - **WAN LipSync terminal tasks:** Skip a terminal InfiniteTalk task that would retain only one frame, shorten the effective plan endpoint, remove transitions at or beyond that endpoint, and report the omitted range and image so one imperceptible frame does not require a complete diffusion pass.

**Changed files:**
- `py/RvVideo_WanLipSyncTimelinePlanner.py`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-03

### Version: 4.3.22

- **Fix**
  - **Accumulated video preview memory:** Reuse an existing IMAGE batch while encoding the complete loop preview instead of concatenating a duplicate full-size tensor. Keep heterogeneous frame-list resizing and concatenation as the fallback, and share the same batch-reuse check with both video save nodes.
  - **Image Selector continuation values:** Freeze every supported dynamic value that produced the displayed images before Confirm re-queues, covering upstream Eclipse, Smart Model Loader, and SmartLLM seed providers; unconnected Smart Prompt and Wildcard Processor seeds; and random, increment, decrement, or shuffle indexes on Read Prompt Files and both folder image loaders. When `seed_input` is connected, preserve the consumer's local special mode and reconstruct direct, Eclipse Set/Get, or optional KJNodes Set/Get provider provenance, while leaving fixed, inactive, ambiguous, removed, unsupported, unrelated, or unresolved values unchanged.
  - **Show Text previews:** Keep the renderer-bound text widget stable across executions and use the shared custom DOM renderer so returned text appears in both Nodes 2.0 and Classic instead of leaving an empty replacement widget. Size a freshly added standard Show Text node after injecting its preview so the widget stays within the node, while leaving the Stop variant's native layout unchanged.
- **Chore**
  - **Shared wildcard links:** Remove the obsolete ComfyUI-Raffle lists-to-wildcards merge and symlink from the shared-link setup.

**Changed files:**
- `core/image_helpers.py`
- `js/eclipse-image-selector.js`
- `js/eclipse-show-text.js`
- `py/RvVideo_Preview.py`
- `py/RvVideo_Save.py`
- `py/RvVideo_SaveData.py`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `scripts/comfyui_symlinks.sh`

## 2026-09-02

### Version: 4.3.21

- **Feat**
  - **Fast Mode Toggle Native:** Add a separate virtual mode-toggle node whose connected targets become native, promotable Boolean controls named from their node titles with stable private target associations and ComfyUI-style collision suffixes. Let each control activate its target or apply the selected Mute/Bypass off mode, while honoring max-one, always-one, and bulk actions. Leave `Fast Mode Toggle [Eclipse]` unchanged.
  - **Native promotion lifecycle:** Preserve customized labels, promotion identities, external links, and target associations across renames, target replacement, demotion, sibling and nested subgraphs, duplication, save/reload, and legacy workflow migration. Reflect external target-mode changes back to every interior and promoted host control.
  - **Post-proxy frontend compatibility:** Propagate direct host-owned switch edits across ComfyUI frontend `1.46.3+`, covering both store-only and live-callback promotion paths in Nodes 2.0 without applying an interaction twice, while retaining the direct callback path for Classic. Detect the observable promotion behavior without frontend-version checks, frame polling, private store imports, or proxy widgets.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-mode-nodes.js`
- `py/RvTools_FastModeToggleNative.py`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-02

### Version: 4.3.20

- **Feat**
  - **Load Audio precision controls:** Add a full-width clip-relative seek slider and current/total playback display with millisecond precision for more exact timeline-planning work. Keep both synchronized across seeking, trim-window changes, source changes, playback completion, and node cleanup.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-load-audio.js`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-01

### Version: 4.3.19

- **Refactor**
  - **Smart Model Loader ownership transfer:** Move `Lora Stack [Eclipse]`, `Lora Stack apply [Eclipse]`, `Nunchaku PuLID Loader [Eclipse]`, and `Nunchaku PuLID Apply [Eclipse]` to ComfyUI Smart Model Loader while preserving their serialized node IDs and input/output contracts. Remove Eclipse's duplicate Nunchaku adapter runtime so model loading, LoRA application, and PuLID all use Smart Model Loader's single wrapper implementation.
- **Docs**
  - **External node ownership:** Direct users to Smart Model Loader for the transferred LoRA Stack and Nunchaku PuLID nodes.

**Changed files:**
- `README.md`
- `Readme/README.md`
- `core/nunchaku_wrapper.py` (removed)
- `extern/__init__.py`
- `extern/nunchaku/` (removed)
- `js/eclipse-lora-stack.js` (moved)
- `py/RvTools_LoraStack.py` (moved)
- `py/RvTools_LoraStack_Apply.py` (moved)
- `py/RvTools_NunchakuPuLID.py` (moved)
- `requirements.txt`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-01

### Version: 4.3.18

- **Fix**
  - **Cosmetic feature-chip workflow compatibility:** Restore the shared pre-4.3.16 workflow slot contract so cosmetic combo-chip rows and their native schema widgets are consumed in the same order during save and reload. Preserve existing workflow values for Save Images, Smart Folder, both Load Image From Folder nodes, Danbooru Corpus Maintenance, and other shared chip callers in Nodes 2.0 and classic.
  - **After updating:** Close each affected workflow tab and reopen the workflow from disk so ComfyUI reconstructs its nodes with the corrected widget order. A browser hard-cache refresh alone does not replace the graph state already loaded in an open workflow.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-combo-chip.js`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-01

### Version: 4.3.17

- **Fix**
  - **Save Video Data workflow reload:** Serialize only the node's native schema widgets so the leading cosmetic feature-chip bar cannot shift `embed_workflow`, feature backings, FPS, filename, codec, quality, or loop controls on reload. Restore named widget values when available and recover workflows saved with the affected leading-null positional layout.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-save-video-data.js`
- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-09-01

### Version: 4.3.16

- **Feat**
  - **Smart Prompt v2 visible reset:** Add a bottom control that returns only currently visible prompt dropdowns to `None`, preserving selections serialized in inactive tag/description folder variants. Keep reset and seed action buttons out of workflow widget data.
  - **Wildcard Processor external seed input:** Replace the connectable local seed and built-in negative filter with a socketless local seed plus optional `seed_input`. Resolve an external seed once per queue through Eclipse's established queue-aware path and reuse it for expansion, execution, queued/last-seed state, and workflow metadata. Scope cached resolved seeds to their graph-to-prompt cycle so consecutive random queues stay synchronized and **Use Last Queued Seed** reproduces the exact last wildcard expansion. Hide local seed controls without resizing while connected, and migrate legacy seed and removed negative links across root graphs and subgraphs without dangling references.
  - **Prompt Styler v2 feature chips:** Add `Prompt Styler v2 [Eclipse]` alongside the unchanged original node, sharing its style application, libraries, endpoint, and fixed/random/increment/decrement queue behavior. Replace four visible Boolean rows with a top-positioned cosmetic feature bar backed by hidden socketless serialized Booleans, retain conditional underscore word limits and stable queue actions, and preserve values across fresh creation, repeated configuration, and workflow reload in Nodes 2.0 and classic.
- **Docs**
  - **Save Video with Generation Data visual tour:** Add three annotated Nodes 2.0 scenes covering inputs and placeholders, the complete feature-chip panel, and seamless-loop controls.
  - **Danbooru visual tour:** Add three annotated Nodes 2.0 scenes covering deterministic Prompt Forge assembly, feature and category filtering, and offline corpus-maintenance controls.
  - **Get First / Get All Active:** Remove obsolete auto-color setting, color table, summary, and usage-tip claims from the detailed guide and documentation index.
  - **Get First / Get All Active visual tour:** Add two annotated Nodes 2.0 scenes covering type filtering, prioritized fallback resolution, aligned named outputs, and the recommended Get All Active → Any Multi-Switch first-non-None pattern.
  - **Load Image From Folder visual tour:** Add three annotated, live-executed Nodes 2.0 scenes covering cumulative multi-folder loading, sorting and image/mask outputs, iteration feature chips, previews, and the metadata-capable Pipe variant connected to IO Load Image.
  - **Batch selection workflow guide:** Add a four-node guide and four annotated, live-executed Nodes 2.0 scenes for aspect-preserving advanced folder loading, ordered Image Selector review, synchronized IO Slice & Dice image/filename routing, and an optional DOM result-review stop.
  - **Save Images visual tour:** Add three annotated, live-executed Nodes 2.0 scenes covering IO Generation Data → `pipe_opt` provenance, feature chips, placeholder naming, WebP quality and DPI controls, and the DOM preview; align documented chip names and list outputs with the current node.
  - **Smart Prompt v2 visual tour:** Add three annotated Nodes 2.0 scenes covering multi-folder prompt libraries, None/Random/exact file choices, reproducible seed controls, prompt output, and external Eclipse Seed synchronization; align nearby v2 folder, default, path, and button guidance with current behavior.
  - **Smart Folder visual tour:** Add three annotated Nodes 2.0 scenes covering the image/video radio modes, layered date and batch paths, image geometry and latent settings, video frame and skip calculations, and the Eclipse Pipe Out consumer; align seed button labels and extracted outputs with the current nodes.
  - **Smart Sampler Settings visual tour:** Add three annotated Nodes 2.0 scenes covering selective core settings, the complete feature-chip panel, advanced guidance/noise/upscale/seed controls, and the connected IO Sampler Settings consumer; rename the guide to remove its stale v2 suffix, update documentation links, and clarify the canonical node ID, resolved seed modes, and current pipe-node names.
  - **Read Prompt Files visual tour:** Add three annotated, live-executed Nodes 2.0 scenes covering ordered multi-file prompts, fixed and special index modes, last-queued reuse, stop behavior, automatic file refresh, and Eclipse Seed synchronization; rename the guide to remove its stale `_Usage` suffix, update documentation links, and align its controls with the current frontend.
  - **Replace String Advanced visual tour:** Rename the guide and all user-facing references to match the displayed node name, add three annotated live Nodes 2.0 scenes covering the standard Read Prompt Files pipeline, feature chips, regex, age, sensitive-text handling, and output verification, document Smart LM Loader and manual text as additional inputs, and clarify that the processor supports other LLM text while its built-in terms and phrases remain primarily fitted to Florence-2-style output and it may be removed in the future.
  - **Wildcard Processor visual tour:** Add three annotated, live-executed Nodes 2.0 scenes covering the Impact-derived template and populated-text flow, current file/inline/weighted/quantity syntax, local-seed live preview, wildcard insertion, the dedicated `seed_input`, hidden local controls with unchanged node dimensions, and queue-time external Eclipse Seed synchronization. Replace obsolete syntax and paths in the guide, document queue-time preview refresh and external-seed precedence, and recommend downstream Filter Prompt for unwanted wording, phrases, or tags.
  - **Prompt Styler visual tour:** Add three annotated, live-executed Nodes 2.0 scenes covering connected positive and negative text, both resolved outputs, mode and style selection, independent application toggles, fixed and special queue-time indexes, last-index reuse, and conditional underscore conversion; align the guide's input and index documentation with the current node.
  - **Prompt Styler v2 guide and visual tour:** Document the separate compact node, its feature defaults and serialized backing behavior, v1 compatibility, and supported index modes with three v2-only annotated captures while preserving the original guide and images.

## 2026-08-31

### Version: 4.3.15

- **Feat (New)**
  - **Save Video with Generation Data:** Add an independent MP4 output node with serialized feature chips, optional audio trim and seamless-loop controls, raw ComfyUI workflow embedding, A1111-compatible Generation Data PIPE metadata, prompt removal, LoRA prompt insertion, workflow JSON sidecars, and model/VAE/LoRA/embedding hashes. Resolve Image Save-compatible date, model, and sampling placeholders in safe nested relative prefixes, with readable missing-PIPE fallbacks and consistent counters, previews, and sidecar names. Preserve the user's node dimensions when chip or trim-mode changes show and hide controls, letting the flexible video preview absorb the layout difference.
- **Feat**
  - **Multi-getter context-menu creation:** Add Get First and Get All Active actions to the shared Eclipse canvas and node right-click submenus. Create at the cursor or beside the clicked node in the active graph, including subgraphs.
- **Fix**
  - **Get All Active reordering:** Move each variable's output slot and normal or floating wire together for up/down/top/bottom, multi-slot, and insertion actions. Preserve every downstream target and corrected origin slot through workflow serialization and reload in Nodes 2.0 and classic canvas.
- **Docs**
  - Document Save Video with Generation Data inputs, chips, metadata precedence and missing-PIPE behavior, placeholders, safe output naming, trim modes, loop controls, and Civitai parser guidance.
  - Document Get First and Get All Active canvas/node creation actions, and clarify that Get All Active output slots and wires move with reordered variables while their downstream connections remain intact.

**Changed files:**
- `Readme/GetFirst_GetAllActive.md`
- `Readme/Save_Video_Data.md` (new)
- `Readme/Set_Get_Bridge.md`

- `pyproject.toml`

## 2026-08-30

### Version: 4.3.14

- **Fix**
  - **Danbooru categorization no-progress guard:** Recover reviewed tags whose underscore separators were changed to literal spaces only when the reverse substitution exactly matches a private batch-manifest tag, without relaxing case, punctuation, or other tag identity checks. When Category Apply commits no valid assignment while tags remain pending, raise an execution error so ComfyUI Auto Queue stops instead of repeatedly preparing and rejecting the same batch.
- **Chore**
  - **Ready-to-use Danbooru corpora:** Package the completed 132,701-tag categorized index and four 100,000-post rating corpora as hash-tracked `.example` defaults. Fresh installs now receive all required Prompt Forge lists automatically, while startup updates continue to preserve user-modified or intentionally deleted runtime files.
- **Docs**
  - Document the constrained underscore recovery, no-progress stop behavior, Qwen 3.5 9B exact-preserving baseline, observed Qwen 3.8 27B underscore normalization, packaged corpus extraction/update behavior, and startup handling for new, unchanged, modified, and intentionally deleted defaults.

**Changed files:**

### Version: 4.3.13

- **Feat (New)**
  - **Danbooru Prompt Forge:** Add an Eclipse-owned V3 output node that deterministically assembles prefix, required, custom, and generated tags from user-provided general, sensitive, questionable, and explicit corpora with first-occurrence deduplication and optional underscore formatting. Provide feature chips, shared seed controls, opt-in missing-tag handling, and optional category filtering; rating-only mode removes corpus metadata without requiring a categorized index, while category mode validates exclusions and applies the configured category order. Keep the large rating corpora outside the distribution so users can import compatible files or build them with Corpus Maintenance.
  - **Danbooru Corpus Maintenance:** Add an Eclipse-owned V3 node that builds and refreshes rating corpora, the authoritative Danbooru tag catalog, and the pending general-tag backlog. Balance collection toward the smallest selected corpus, search high-score bands first, support automatic or custom score ranges up to 5,000, and combine sparse score-index pages with persisted randomized post-ID regions, descending cursors, and one newest-results wrap. Preserve resumable per-rating checkpoints and published responses across request limits and retryable server failures; provide rating rewind/resume, catalog-only refresh, a configurable target up to 100,000 posts per rating, and a node-local `Stop requests → categorize` handoff. Filter newly returned posts through a multiline exact-tag exclusion list accepting commas or line breaks, with adjacent separators, blanks, and duplicates ignored.
  - **Reviewed categorization and Category Apply:** Add an independent two-pass SmartLLM workflow and a V3 apply node for pending general tags. Ground both passes with the live category rules, compact examples, failure-case pairs, explicit boundary guidance, and strict minified JSON contracts; validate results against private batch manifests, preserve canonical tags such as `<o>_<o>`, recover only unambiguous manifest-ordered assignments from narrowly malformed or truncated output, and leave unusable tags pending. Publish accepted assignments atomically in category/tag order, block the chain when no work exists, gate categorization-enabled collection while a backlog is pending, and provide a confirmed reset that rebuilds the backlog while preserving rating files, checkpoints, and authoritative metadata.
  - **Provider-neutral manual categorization:** Add a mutually exclusive manual action that exports the complete ordered backlog in deterministic numbered batches with the live rules, two-pass prompt contracts, categorized reference, content-derived snapshot manifest, and documented draft/review paths. Reuse unchanged packages without overwriting user results, reject modified generated inputs and unsafe symlinks, keep all SmartLLM-chain outputs blocked, and leave result consumption entirely to users or external tooling.
- **Refactor**
  - **Repository-owned prompt data:** Stop inspecting, migrating, renaming, deleting, or creating Eclipse's former `models/Eclipse/*` convenience links during startup. Retain recursive hash-aware `.example` extraction for Eclipse configuration, prompts, patterns, styles, and wildcards, preserving user edits and intentional deletions while seeding new packaged defaults. Continue exposing repository-owned prompts through the dedicated `models/wildcards/smart_prompt` junction or symlink; verify its resolved target on Windows and Linux, repair wrong or dangling links, and refuse to replace a real directory already at that path.
- **Docs**
  - Document Prompt Forge rating-only and category-filtered operation; corpus import and collection; adaptive pagination, exclusions, checkpoints, request stopping, catalog refresh, backlog gating, categorization reset, and the 100,000-post rating target; direct two-SmartLLM wiring, deterministic greedy settings, compact JSON budgeting, review recovery, credentials, publication, manifests, and backups; the manual remote-LLM export workflow and external-only result handling; repository-owned default extraction and prompt paths without `models/Eclipse` convenience links; and tested model guidance led by Qwen 3.x 8B/9B.

## 2026-08-24

### Version: 4.3.12

- **Fix**
  - **Committed setter names:** Let Mode Bridge Set and regular Eclipse Set names remain editable drafts in Nodes 2.0, then validate them (and trim bridge names) and apply duplicate suffixes only on Enter, focus leave, or serialization; propagate only committed names to getters and automatic titles while preserving custom node titles and classic modal behavior.
  - **FX color pickers:** Restore native color controls for Image with FX and Text Image with FX in current Nodes 2.0 by matching semantic input labels first while retaining the older label-row lookup as a fallback, including colors revealed later by glow, shadow, and stroke controls, and render a full-height rounded color swatch instead of the browser's thin default line.

## 2026-08-24

### Version: 4.3.11

- **Fix**
  - **Fresh-subgraph getter lists:** Refresh Nodes 2.0 combo reactivity after Eclipse's settled add/paste coordination so Set/Get and Mode Bridge getter dropdowns immediately see names from their newly attached graph without a workflow reload, while preserving classic canvas behavior and existing selections.
  - **Kargim tiled-decode controls:** Update `tile_size` visibility immediately when `tiled_decode` changes in classic canvas and Nodes 2.0, preserve manually resized height while previews are enabled so the preview absorbs row changes, retain automatic resizing when preview is `None`, and restore the correct state after workflow reloads.
  - **Compact collapsed-node restoration:** Preserve each collapsed node's latest expanded dimensions through root/subgraph remounts while treating an already-expanded node's live size as authoritative, preventing stale cached geometry from resizing expanded root nodes after navigation.

## 2026-08-22

### Version: 4.3.10

- **Fix**
  - **Concat Pipe Multi recursion:** Ignore nested transport-level `pipe` keys and return one flat merged context so ComfyUI 0.33.1 can inspect outputs without recursive model tracking or duplicate field displays.
  - **Loaded image sampling metadata:** Reverse Image Save's CivitAI fallback encoding so combined values such as `er_sde_simple` restore separate `sampler_name: er_sde` and `scheduler: simple` pipe fields.
  - **Legacy subgraph DOM previews:** Give duplicate promoted preview views source-specific runtime names and keep each rendered DOM row bound to its concrete source across both frontend 1.46.2 row layouts, even when ordinary promoted controls are filtered or another preview is populated later, so Preview Image and Load Image remain independently visible through reload and live updates.
  - **Load Image control alignment:** Remove the extra horizontal inset from the source chips, image selector, and URL controls so their outer edges align with the DOM preview in both renderers.
  - **LoRA Stack control alignment:** Match the mode-chip edges to native widget rows in Nodes 2.0 while retaining the canvas-specific inset that aligns them with classic dropdowns.

- `core/image_metadata.py`

- `js/eclipse-subgraph-dom-previews.js`
- `pyproject.toml`

### Version: 4.3.9

- **Fix**
  - **Responsive image grid:** Keep grid-picker thumbnails at a fixed size, recompute the number of rows and columns as the resizable popover dimensions change, and reserve a bottom gutter so the scrollbar stays clear of the resize handle.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-image-browser.js`
- `pyproject.toml`

### Version: 4.3.8

- **Feat**
  - **Configurable chip accent:** Add an Eclipse-owned color picker that persists a validated hexadecimal accent in private `config.json` and applies derived hover, border, trigger, and contrast colors immediately to shared combo chips plus the standalone LoRA Stack and direct Load Image source-mode chips.
  - **Aligned chip popovers:** Size shared combo-chip popovers to the rendered trigger-bar width while preserving every chip's intrinsic dimensions.
  - **Image grid picker:** Replace the visible filename combos and standalone upload, refresh, and delete controls on both direct Load Image nodes with an Eclipse-owned, renderer-independent browser featuring a viewport-clamped resizable popover, virtualized lazy grid/list views, filename search and ordering, keyboard navigation, persistent layout, ordering, and popover-size preferences, multi-upload with partial-failure reporting, deterministic deletion, and complete lifecycle cleanup while retaining the original serialized backing values, source modes, previews, drag/drop, clipboard, and Mask Editor behavior.

## 2026-08-19

### Version: 4.3.7

- **Refactor**
  - **Smart detection postprocessor extraction:** Move Detection to Bboxes and its conditional-widget frontend to `ComfyUI_SmartLLM`, preserving its `[Eclipse]` ID, schema, list semantics, mask/bbox outputs, and workflow serialization.

- **Docs**
  - Point Detection to Bboxes to SmartLLM alongside the Smart Detection node whose structured output it consumes.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-detection-to-bboxes.js` (removed)
- `py/RvConversion_DetectionToBboxes.py` (removed)
- `README.md`
- `Readme/README.md`
- `pyproject.toml`

### Version: 4.3.6

- **Refactor**
  - **Complete pipeline extraction:** Move CLIP Text Encode, CLIP Text Encode (Advanced), Conditioning Zero Out, IO Checkpoint Loader, and Eclipse KSampler (Pipe) to `ComfyUI_SmartModelLoader` while preserving their exact `[Eclipse]` IDs, schemas, categories, pipe contracts, and workflow serialization.
  - **Single frontend ownership:** Remove the Advanced encoder extension and stop Eclipse seed/preview hooks from targeting the transferred pipe sampler, preventing double wrapping when both packs are installed.

- **Docs**
  - Point the transferred conditioning, pipe IO, and sampler nodes to their standalone provider while retaining Eclipse's generic pipe toolkit, Conditioning Passer, Kargim sampler, resolution pipes, and workflow utilities.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-clip-text-encode-advanced.js` (removed)

## 2026-08-17

### Version: 4.3.5

- **Fix**
  - **Smart-resize subgraph and renderer transitions:** Restart the existing visibility-aware smart resize when graphs or renderers change, cancel work started under the prior strategy, refresh Nodes 2.0 mount observation and cached elements, query exact escaped node IDs, reject DOM decoys, prefer the newest valid remount, and verify logical and CSS dimensions through the asynchronous layout-store settling window; this prevents external Smart Model Loader nodes and other conditional-widget nodes from reverting to oversized or cross-renderer geometry after navigation and live Nodes 2.0/classic switches.
  - **Hidden widget slot lifecycle:** Install classic drag-targeting guards even when a visibility manager is created in Nodes 2.0, synchronize hidden slot state in both renderers, disconnect every linked slot in one synchronous user-driven batch, restore prior draw state, and clean up temporary auto-target markers even when LiteGraph throws.
  - **Settings initialization safety:** Hydrate Eclipse defaults from its own redacted config endpoint and suppress ComfyUI's automatic first change callback so persisted frontend state cannot write stale values back to Eclipse configuration.
  - **Nodes 2.0 classic group menus:** Route group right-clicks through the complete classic canvas menu, retaining its existing group mode, fit, selection, extension, and third-party actions plus the standard `Edit Group` submenu, while preserving reroute and empty-canvas behavior.
  - **Explicit custom-color labels:** Rename the custom node color actions to identify title, background, and combined title/background colors clearly in both classic and Nodes 2.0 menus.
  - **Eclipse-only data reset:** Restrict both reset scripts to Eclipse-owned prompts, patterns, styles, wildcards, and root configuration so they no longer delete or promise to re-extract companion-owned templates, registries, LLM configuration, or Docker state.

- **Perf**
  - **Smart-resize lifecycle scheduling:** Track outstanding resize demand so renderer switches resume only interrupted or pending nodes instead of recomputing every stable registration, preserve settled geometry through renderer-owned layout-store writes with a bounded cached-geometry check that performs no size computation or explicit dirty call, and retain full active-graph correction for graph returns; coalesce overlapping graph events, merge graph and remount restarts, cancel inactive-graph probes, share post-apply verification across nodes, reuse stabilized measurements, and skip no-op CSS writes and canvas invalidation while retaining four-frame verification and the 60-frame safety bound.

- **Refactor**
  - **Standalone diffusion-loader pack:** Move Smart Model Loader, Model Loader, Model Loader Pipe, CLIP Loader, VAE Loader, VAE Loader Video+Audio, their templates, GGUF support, verified CivitAI acquisition, and the Download Manager into `ComfyUI_SmartModelLoader` while preserving the six `[Eclipse]` workflow node IDs and bundle schema compatibility.
  - **Standalone SmartLLM pack:** Move Smart LM Loader, Smart Detection, the Registry Manager, native and container backends, model acquisition and integrity, defaults, configuration, security, Docker tooling, and Florence-2 support into `ComfyUI_SmartLLM` 1.0.0 while preserving both `[Eclipse]` node IDs, schemas, and the `/smartlml` API contract.
  - **Neutral retained infrastructure:** Relocate Universal Block Swap to `core/blockswap.py`, retain only Image Save's required hashing helpers in `core/model_integrity.py`, preserve LoRA Stack's Nunchaku support, and keep Load Audio and cross-pack detection, image-selection, preview, and seed integrations in Eclipse.
  - **Confirmed config extraction cleanup:** Remove loader-owned fields only after value-free companion migration markers confirm examination, require both Smart Model Loader and SmartLLM before removing shared token and retry fields, delete matching comments in the same private atomic transaction, and retain all Eclipse-owned and unrelated values.

- **Docs**
  - **External loader provider:** Point Eclipse users to `ComfyUI_SmartModelLoader` for the extracted nodes, loader guides, templates, security policy, and Download Manager.
  - **External SmartLLM provider:** Point users to `ComfyUI_SmartLLM` for Smart LM Loader, Smart Detection, the Registry Manager, backend setup, Docker installation, migration, and security documentation.
  - **Independent settings ownership:** Document the separate `Eclipse`, `Smart Model Loader`, and `Smart LM Loader` categories, config files, credentials, endpoints, log levels, and retry policies.
  - **SmartLLM registry-reference ownership:** Remove Eclipse's remaining copy-paste model registry guide after transferring it to `ComfyUI_SmartLLM`, and correct Eclipse folder and file-location documentation to name the owning companion pack.

- **Chore**
  - **Loader-only cleanup:** Remove loader and Download Manager registration, routes, settings, migrations, frontend assets, defaults, GGUF vendor code, and the unused `gguf` dependency from Eclipse without deleting existing ignored user configuration, templates, queue state, or partial downloads.
  - **SmartLLM cleanup:** Remove Smart LM registration and startup, `/smartlml` routes, settings, legacy migrations, frontend assets, defaults, registries, Docker scripts, Florence-2 vendor code, audit tooling, and SmartLLM-only dependencies without deleting ignored user configuration, registry edits, prompts, Docker mappings, model files, provenance, partial downloads, or existing links.
  - **Legacy extracted credential cleanup:** Remove the former Smart LM Gemini API key and its description from Eclipse defaults and runtime configuration.

- **Breaking**
  - **Loader and Download Manager extraction:** Eclipse no longer supplies the six diffusion loader nodes or Download Manager. Install `ComfyUI_SmartModelLoader`; external HTTP clients must migrate from Eclipse-owned routes and events to `/smart-model-loader/...`.
  - **Smart LM and Detection extraction:** Eclipse no longer registers Smart LM Loader, Smart Detection, the Registry Manager, or `/smartlml` routes. Install `ComfyUI_SmartLLM`; saved workflows continue to resolve the unchanged `[Eclipse]` node IDs through that pack.

### Version: 4.3.4

- **Feat**
  - **Image Convert alpha compositing and category:** Replace the redundant remove-alpha toggle with optional straight-alpha compositing onto a background color selected through matching classic and Nodes 2.0 native pickers with a roomier rounded Vue swatch, visibly normalize styles—including `none`—shifted by the new widget position when loading older workflows, leave non-RGBA inputs unchanged, and move the node from Conversion to Image/FX & Color.

- **Fix**
  - **Nodes 2.0 initial preview sizing:** Give freshly created dedicated image, video, audio, text, SEGS, optional wildcard, and unconstrained MatchType display outputs—including both Show Any variants—a 225 × 225 minimum expanded model size through Vue's initial settling frames while preserving larger dimensions, contained DOM widgets, classic canvas behavior, subgraph hosts, and every configured, cloned, or later manually resized size.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-conversion-nodes.js`
- `js/eclipse-node-size-fix.js`
- `py/RvConversion_ImageConvert.py`
- `pyproject.toml`

---

### Version: 4.3.3

- **Feat**
  - **Subgraph DOM previews:** Add a persistent `Eclipse -> DOM previews` submenu for exposing independent image and text preview widgets directly on current ComfyUI subgraph nodes, including nested subgraphs and classic or Nodes 2 rendering.

- **Fix**
  - **Instance-correct preview updates:** Route executed output through colon-delimited display-node paths and propagate manual preview changes one subgraph boundary at a time so multiple instances of one definition remain independent.
  - **Direct-widget compatibility, lifecycle, sizing, and culling:** Detect whether subgraph hosts retain direct custom widgets, hide the Eclipse menu and leave saved mappings intact on unsupported frontends, rebuild exposed previews after workflow load without altering saved subgraph dimensions, exclude their values from workflow serialization, cleanly remove disabled projections, and cull host-owned DOM widgets without relying on removed promoted-widget internals.
  - **Subgraph native-image suppression:** Clear standard image output through the owning graph's locator after Eclipse routing completes and mark DOM-preview nodes as custom-rendered, preventing the native background/media preview from appearing beside the Eclipse widget inside subgraphs.
  - **Frontend compatibility:** The new direct subgraph DOM-preview experience requires ComfyUI frontend 1.51.2 or newer; older frontends remain supported through capability-detected fallbacks, including legacy promoted previews where available, while unsupported direct-widget controls stay hidden and saved mappings are preserved.

**Changed files:**

## 2026-08-12

### Version: 4.3.2

- **Feat (New)**
  - **Standalone Download Manager (Beta):** Add a separate CivitAI and Hugging Face inspection modal with its own semantic paged data grid, responsive and desktop-resizable styles, state, APIs, persistence, progress events, left-toolbar launcher, Eclipse menu command, and classic-menu button while leaving the Smart LM Registry Editor unchanged.
  - **Persistent verified transfer queue:** Add and import jobs in a manual-start ready state; provide selected start and inactive-record removal controls; process started transfers one at a time; atomically persist immutable provider identity, registered destinations, provider and local digests, conflicts, progress, timestamps, and sanitized failures; recover interrupted jobs; retain cancelled partials for validated retries with an explicit destination-locked Delete Partial action; and allow cancellation only before non-abortable hashing, verification, locking, and promotion.
  - **Download bundles:** Preserve provider provenance, expected and local digests, destination assignments, and conflict policies in portable bundles without coupling the Download Manager to Smart Model Loader templates.

- **Feat**
  - **Immutable provider inspection:** List every CivitAI version file from AIR, exact AIR, SHA-256, model-version URL, or download URL; suggest identity-verified author filenames with precision/file-ID collision fallbacks while preserving REST filenames; and page immutable Hugging Face repository/file results resolved to full commits with LFS/Xet SHA-256 or regular Git blob identity.
  - **Live destination policy:** Populate categories and roots from ComfyUI's registered model folders; collapse identical root registrations; distinguish same-named roots without exposing absolute paths; provide metadata and filename suggestions with ambiguity confirmation; and support search, sorting, filtered select-all, supported-file toggles, selected-rows-only bulk assignment with accessible flow guidance, and per-row overrides.
  - **Provider-neutral verified acquisition:** Extend the hardened transactional transfer primitive to verify regular Hugging Face Git blob identities without changing existing CivitAI SHA-256 behavior, cancellation timing, containment, resume validation, destination locking, or atomic promotion.
  - **Download Manager trust boundary:** Reject arbitrary roots, absolute paths, traversal, symlinks, incompatible extensions, unverifiable files, oversized requests, cross-origin mutations, and remote multi-user global access; exclude credentials, headers, and signed URLs from queue and bundle persistence.

- **Docs**
  - **Download Manager guide and research:** Document launch surfaces, provider locators, immutable identity, format exceptions, queue recovery, cancellation, bundles, and the validation boundary.

## 2026-08-11

### Version: 4.3.1

- **Feat**
  - **Secure diffusion model loading:** Resolve checkpoints, UNets, GGUF models, CLIP, VAE, audio VAE, and LoRAs through their declared ComfyUI folder roles; allow configured role roots to resolve through symlinks while rejecting traversal, symlinked files or subfolders beneath those roots, unsupported files, malformed workflow values, and unsafe component settings before cleanup or deserialization while retaining baked CLIP/VAE/audio-VAE compatibility for supported UNet files.
  - **Administrator-local legacy-format policy:** Deny pickle-capable .ckpt, .pt, .pth, and .bin artifacts by default and add Eclipse.AllowLegacyModelFormats as an immediate local-only override that is never stored in workflows or templates.
  - **Model-aware download precision:** Expose the complete CivitAI precision and GGUF quantization superset while dynamically showing only standard precisions or GGUF Q/IQ/TQ choices for the selected model type.
  - **Transfer-only download abort:** Reuse the CivitAI download button as a percentage-preserving abort control during network transfer, then close cancellation before hashing, verification, locking, and promotion while showing live in-place transfer, hashing, and verification percentages plus phase status in the node and console.

- **Fix**
  - **Verified integrity and CivitAI acquisition:** Replace timestamp trust with stable versioned SHA-256 metadata, serialize concurrent transfers per canonical destination, compare the primary selected model against trusted hashes when available while allowing metadata-free local models to load after recording a baseline, retain unconditional auxiliary-component path and format validation, validate AIR model/version/file identities, constrain DNS and redirects to public addresses, enforce strict resume and resource limits, and atomically promote only verified downloads.
  - **Transactional persistence and maintenance:** Group persistent JSON coordination anchors under private per-directory `.locks` folders; lock, flush, fsync, and atomically replace template and integrity JSON while preserving malformed files; hold ComfyUI's queue mutex during destructive maintenance, apply model-format validation to exact template-selected deletion targets, remove canonical and legacy sidecars, and retain tombstone rollback.
  - **Hardened model-loader endpoints:** Keep existing URLs while bounding JSON-object requests, strictly validating destructive booleans, rejecting cross-origin mutations, limiting multi-user global changes to loopback clients, offloading blocking model I/O, sanitizing failures, and reconciling audio_vae across frontend and backend feature definitions.
  - **Role-correct CivitAI file selection:** Select by target role before exact identity, precision, or primary status; support checkpoint-classified standalone diffusion variants such as Z-Image while model roles still exclude auxiliary files, component roles remain isolated, canonical AIR types override stale input tokens, `default` retains the primary artifact while an explicit precision selects a unique largest match, exact `+fileId` AIR identities survive persistence, and same-precision filename collisions gain a stable CivitAI file-ID suffix without changing hash verification.
  - **Filename-free template metadata:** Rebuild locator and expected-hash metadata from the visible AIR/SHA editor when saving a template under a new name, remove cleared inherited metadata, and consume only the locator used by a verified download.
  - **General settings category:** Rename the visible `Eclipse → Generic` subsection to `Eclipse → General` across general controls and Groups Panel sorting while preserving all setting IDs and stored values.

- **Refactor**
  - **Shared model-loader core:** Consolidate validation, loading, pipes, BlockSwap, templates, integrity, acquisition, lifecycle, and endpoint helpers under core/model_loader while retaining compatibility re-exports and unchanged node IDs, sockets, pipe keys, templates, and workflow serialization.

- **Docs**
  - **Diffusion loader security guide:** Document safe formats, integrity provenance, CivitAI and endpoint boundaries, the threat model, and a clearly opt-in real-model compatibility ledger.

### Version: 4.3.0

- **Feat (New)**
  - **Smart LM Registry Editor (Beta):** Add a guided interface for inspecting, adding, editing, downloading, verifying, and removing registry entries or local model files across all supported Smart LM backends.

- **Feat**
  - **Expanded Smart LM backend support:** Add explicit llama.cpp registry routing, native vLLM entries, corrected Linux Docker vLLM routing, and new curated llama.cpp/GGUF models with verified metadata.

- **Fix**
  - **Verified model acquisition and integrity:** Pin supported artifacts to immutable upstream revisions and exact SHA-256 hashes; verify downloads, repairs, and existing local files; recover interrupted repositories; preserve resumable progress; and prevent incomplete or corrupted models from being treated as usable.
  - **Safer checkpoint loading:** Restrict YOLO and legacy Florence checkpoints to reviewed weights-only loading, validate Florence shard completeness and model state, and require immutable pins before registry-provided remote code can run.
  - **Hardened Docker backends:** Pin managed images by release tag and digest, recreate containers when effective settings change, use read-only model mounts and stronger isolation, and remove shell command construction from Ollama imports.
  - **More reliable backend execution:** Correct vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, and Ollama routing, startup, reuse, quantization, parallelism, compile-mode, NVIDIA-driver, transport-error, and diagnostic handling.
  - **Accurate device and load planning:** Make Transformers, Florence, and WD14 honor effective device, precision, attention, memory, fallback, and cache identity instead of silently reusing incompatible state.
  - **Exception-safe lifecycle and maintenance:** Guarantee cleanup after successful or failed execution, preserve the original error when cleanup also fails, and prevent verification or deletion from racing active model use.
  - **Secure endpoints and persistence:** Reject cross-origin mutations, restrict global multi-user changes to loopback clients, bound request bodies, protect credentials, and atomically persist configuration, registry, provenance, and Docker state without losing concurrent updates.
  - **Transactional model preparation:** Make Mistral conversion explicit and recoverable, with resource preflight, validated temporary outputs, atomic completion, and interrupted-output quarantine.
  - **Output cleanup and privacy:** Apply one generated-text cleanup contract across backends and keep prompts, responses, backend bodies, images, and credentials out of normal logs.

- **Docs**
  - **Smart LM security and setup guides:** Document the registry editor, verified downloads, Docker isolation, credential handling, backend requirements, and remaining trust boundaries.

- **Fix**
  - **Nodes 2.0 compact collapsed nodes:** Reapply fallback compact geometry, expanded-width caps, resize observation, logical bounds, and paint tiers whenever viewport virtualization remounts a node, while keeping expanded z-index values stable and limiting remount work to the replacement element.

- `js/eclipse-node-size-fix.js`
- `js/eclipse-vue-node-settings.js`
- `js/eclipse-vue-node-viewport-virtualization.js` (removed)

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-mode-nodes.js`
- `pyproject.toml`

---

## 2026-08-01

### Version: 4.2.6

- **Feat**
  - **Nodes 2.0 viewport virtualization:** Add opt-in, exact settled-viewport component suppression through the public frontend rendering API, with two-frame hydration, interaction-safe retention, immediate disable restoration, native-setting precedence, update deduplication, and fail-open compatibility.

- **Fix**
  - **Classic Nodes 2.0 context menus:** Preserve Eclipse-owned preview menus, browser text editing, and native audio/video menus while routing ordinary images to image-aware LiteGraph actions and retaining complete classic widget and node menus.

---

## 2026-07-30

### Version: 4.2.5

- **Fix**
  - **Nodes 2.0 collapsed display:** Share canonical setting metadata and migration precedence, always preserve expanded dimensions on vanilla frontends, and limit compact mode to natural collapsed width, header spacing, and price/status suppression while retaining the pin.
  - **Nodes 2.0 stacking:** Match the native unselected-collapsed, expanded, and selected-collapsed paint tiers on vanilla frontends while preserving native order and pointer ownership across selection, remount, and graph-navigation changes.
  - **Nodes 2.0 badges and low detail:** Hide only Muted/Bypassed status badges, cover all native detail surfaces with layout-preserving low-detail visibility, use the strict full-detail threshold, and cleanly rebind or remove fallbacks across canvas and renderer changes.
  - **Native capability boundary:** Bypass Eclipse display fallbacks when the frontend implements them and keep viewport virtualization absent on vanilla frontends.

**Changed files:**
- `.defaults/config.json.example`
- `core/server_endpoints.py`
- `js/eclipse-node-size-fix.js`
- `js/eclipse-ui-enhancements.js`

- `pyproject.toml`

---

### Version: 4.2.4

- **Fix**
  - **Eclipse KSampler previews:** Preserve authoritative live, final, and hidden phases when viewport virtualization remounts or replaces Nodes 2.0 node elements, even when raw and reactive preview caches diverge, and clear transient previews with the correct root or subgraph `NodeLocatorId` key.
  - **Dynamic widget sizing:** Reapply the current visibility-driven geometry when viewport virtualization remounts or replaces Nodes 2.0 node elements, so Smart Model Loader and other conditional-widget nodes return at the correct height after panning or offscreen changes while classic canvas behavior remains unchanged.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-sampler-tiled-decode.js`
- `js/eclipse-widget-performance-utils.js`
- `pyproject.toml`

---

## 2026-07-25

### Version: 4.2.3

- **Feat**
  - **Eclipse settings organization:** Organize all thirteen controls under `Eclipse → Generic`, `Eclipse → Nodes 2.0`, and `Eclipse → Smart LM Loader`, with simplified labels, deterministic ordering, and Groups Panel access guidance while preserving stored IDs, callbacks, and write-only token handling.
  - **Classic Nodes 2.0 context menu:** Add an opt-in, immediately applied compatibility setting that replaces the PrimeVue node and widget menu with the complete classic LiteGraph menu, including Eclipse and third-party nested entries, callbacks, separators, and disabled states.

- **Fix**
  - **Eclipse KSampler previews:** In Nodes 2.0, preserve explicit live, final, and hidden phases across root and nested-subgraph navigation, so Vue remounts and reruns cannot reveal a stale preview; successful runs show only the new final, while errors or interruptions restore the last successful output and classic canvas behavior remains unchanged.

- **Perf**
  - **Nodes 2.0 interaction:** Limit collapsed-bound correction to collapsed nodes, batch graph-navigation size synchronization, suspend classic preview-culling scans and timers in the Vue renderer, clear stale promoted-widget culling state on renderer changes, replace relational badge selectors, and skip identical native size-style writes while preserving classic culling and dynamic-widget resizing.

**Changed files:**
- `js/eclipse-groups-panel.js`
- `js/eclipse-node-size-fix.js`

- `extern/impact/impact_sampling.py`
- `py/RvSampler_DetailerForEach.py`
- `pyproject.toml`

---

### Version: 4.2.1

- **Feat (New)**
  - **Compact workflow IDs:** Add an action-bar command that safely renumbers active-workflow nodes in saved canvas order, places each subgraph definition's internal nodes directly after its first visual instance with recursive depth-first numbering, compacts link IDs, repairs duplicate IDs, removes orphaned links and stale slot references, preserves valid topology and special IDs, validates changes atomically, and participates in normal undo and Save handling.

- **Fix**
  - **Text DOM previews:** Restore hover-focused wheel scrolling in Nodes 2.0 for Show Text and Show Any variants, hand wheel input back to canvas zoom at text boundaries, and preserve classic-renderer behavior.

**Changed files:**

  - **Loop Image Selector:** Pass a single image source or one-frame batch and existing loop context through unchanged without redundant selection or transition blending.
  - **Save Video:** Report throttled ComfyUI progress while encoding frames and finalizing the output container.
  - **UI Enhancements:** Add an enabled-by-default, server-backed option to hide Muted and Bypassed badges in Nodes 2.0 without changing node state, serialization, or execution.

- **Fix**
  - **Nodes 2.0 sizing:** Preserve compact, collapsed, saved, and manually resized dimensions across fresh and loaded workflows, renderer switches, and root or nested subgraphs; keep logical bounds, connection positions, stacking, and CSS width aligned with rendered nodes.
  - **Image and video previews:** Contain intrinsic media sizing for Image Selector, Load Image variants, Preview Image, Preview Mask, Save Images, video previews, and Image Comparer while retaining aspect ratios, minimum sizes, internal scrolling, independent folder-preview resizing, and classic-renderer behavior.
  - **Image Selector and combo-chip controls:** Restore immediate focused wheel scrolling with canvas navigation at grid boundaries, clean up interaction listeners during rebuild/removal, and match combo-chip bar height between Nodes 2.0 and classic rendering.
  - **Context menus and mode controls:** Restore multi-node Custom Title/BG/All actions, hoverable deep navigation and reorder submenus, and reliable Fast Mode Switcher and Toggle promotion for every subgraph instance after workflow load.
  - **Dynamic type links:** Preserve wildcard, reordered-union, compatible-subset, and subgraph links across workflow reloads for Convert Primitive, Any Multi-Switch, and Set/Get using deterministic type restoration and LiteGraph-compatible validation.
  - **Network and API security:** Block image-download SSRF across DNS and redirects, enforce component-aware CivitAI paths, keep Hugging Face tokens write-only, and use safe LoRA deserialization.
  - **Frontend lifecycle:** Remove Load Image document listeners with their nodes and always unwind shared graph-to-prompt state after serialization failures.
  - **Image and video correctness:** Preserve sanitized Color Match targets, clamp resized image and mask outputs, convert normalized Smart Detection coordinates to original-image pixels, and normalize loop-mode Save Video frames before resizing.
  - **VRAM purge:** Synchronize aggressive model unloading, garbage collection, and accelerator cache clearing while failing safely without interrupting workflows.
  - **Smart LM and progress titles:** Preserve compact Smart LM Loader height across reloads and restore serialized custom or schema display names after progress updates in Smart LM and folder batch loaders.
  - **Image Convert:** Match the V3 `remove_alpha` input keyword and defer optional pilgram dependency failures until a style filter is selected.
  - **Image Comparer:** Replace overflowing A/B batch labels with a responsive matching-pair navigator that remains clear of sockets and clickable in both renderers.

- **Perf**
  - **Nodes 2.0 low-zoom rendering:** Add enabled-by-default, configurable detail reduction that preserves titles, shells, sockets, links, execution indicators, and layout while suppressing expensive controls and previews below the cutoff.
  - **Bounded I/O:** Stream image transfers within the 100 MB limit, reuse timed Smart LM responses, and move CivitAI resolution/hash work and audio slicing to bounded worker tasks.
  - **Save Video:** Reuse homogeneous input batches during loop processing instead of concatenating duplicate full-size tensors.

- **Docs**
  - **RIFE Multiplier:** Clarify that interpolation targets should be at least twice the source FPS because lower targets may round to an unsupported 1× no-op.

  - **Image Resolution Pipes:** Added `Image Resolution Pipe` and `Image Resolution Simple Pipe` nodes for passing custom resolution and batch settings through workflows.
  - **List/Batch Conversion:** Added MatchType-based `To List` and `To Batch` nodes for converting and consolidating list and batch inputs.
  - **Load Batch From Folder (Step Advanced):** Added advanced resizing, sorting, paged `batch_index` execution, automatic queue advancement, and source-file list output.
  - **IO Slice & Dice:** Added direct index-based slicing for connected text, conditioning, latent, image, and list inputs, with the selected indices passed downstream.
  - **Filter Prompt:** Added tag, string, parenthesis, and wildcard-expression filtering while preserving the remaining prompt formatting.
  - **Image Batch Extend With RIFE:** Added an experimental gradient-MSE pyramid transition node with optional RIFE replacement of center frames and safe fallback behavior.

- **Feat**
  - **Convert Primitive / To List:** Added recursive list and tuple flattening, element-wise scalar conversion, boolean numeric fallbacks, and newline/comma string splitting.
  - **Image Selector:** Added an `indices` output, an "All" action, stacked status controls, stable in-memory preview caching, and improved selection reset behavior.
  - **Routers and Passers:** Added Generic MatchType and native list-wise execution across switches, conditionals, and pass-through nodes, including safe `[None]` fallbacks.
  - **List/Batch Processing:** Added native list and batch handling across image transforms, loaders, video nodes, tile nodes, batch operations, and text deduplication.
  - **Save Prompt:** Added list-wise execution and source-folder-anchored output paths while retaining containment for ordinary relative paths.
  - **Smart LM:** Added loader-template core-model deletion, newline-only Prompt Variations output, batch and WD14 progress reporting, title updates, and automatic WD14 layout resizing.
  - **Workflow Utilities:** Added multi-slot reordering menus to GetAllActive/GetFirst, batch-frame support to Tile Split, and explicit camera-angle guidance to vision prompts.

- **Fix**
  - **Tile Assembly:** Corrected batch/list reconstruction in Tile Assembly and Tile Decode & Assembly with native list input/output handling.
  - **Image Selector:** Corrected one-image-per-row and fixed-column layouts, resize loops, nested batch extraction, stale selections, fingerprint instability, and preview flashing after discard/reset.
  - **Folder Loaders:** Added memory caches tied to file-list invalidation and restored clean titles after interrupted scanning, loading, or resizing.
  - **WD14:** Added persistent CPU fallback for CUDA/cuDNN failures so batch tagging does not repeatedly retry a failing GPU provider.
  - **Save Prompt:** Handled `None` and empty text inputs and corrected `%source_base_folder` resolution when using `filename_opt` without a pipe.
  - **IO Slice & Dice:** Corrected recursive flattening, batch-size alignment, conditioning slicing, image/image-list cross-population, and mixed-size batch fitting.
  - **List/Batch Output Protocol:** Centralized list-wrapped outputs to prevent ComfyUI V3 from auto-slicing 4D tensors into invalid 3D downstream inputs; updated Image Resize accordingly.
  - **Convert Primitive:** Corrected multi-element tensor boolean conversion and added graceful fallbacks for conversion errors.
  - **Smart LM and Migration:** Restored clean node titles after interruption/errors and stopped manually deleted defaults from being recreated on startup.
  - **Save Images:** Added safe nested `filename_prefix` folders while keeping counters and workflow JSON beside the images and preventing output-path escape.

- **Refactor**
  - **Centralized List/Batch Helpers:** Added shared unwrapping, flattening, size fitting, batch detection, and output preparation utilities and adopted them across the node pack.
  - **Type Handling:** Modernized dynamic node types and list propagation around ComfyUI V3 MatchType.
  - **Formatting:** Reformatted the Python codebase with Black for consistent PEP 8 style.

- **Perf**
  - **Save Video:** Encodes flattened frame views directly, defers resizing until encoding, avoids copying unchanged single batches, and evaluates loop candidates in bounded inference chunks.
  - **Folder Loaders:** Reads dimensions from headers, downsizes with PIL before tensor conversion, and reuses decoded images from memory caches.
  - **Image Loaders:** Returns native image/mask lists to avoid large contiguous RAM/VRAM allocations.

- **Chore**
  - Moved superseded Convert To List, Convert To Batch, and Load Batch From Folder (Advanced) implementations into the legacy module.

- **Breaking**
  - **Smart LM Loader:** Removed the `exclude_tags` widget and backend filter in favor of Filter Prompt, and moved `seed` below `replace_underscore`.
  - **Image Selector:** Replaced the legacy secondary list output with the `indices` output used by IO Slice & Dice.

- **feat:** added native list-of-images and list-of-masks input support to various nodes (Resize, Rescale, Soften, Filter Adjustments, Inset & Crop, Color Match, Upscale, Save, Smart Model Loader, Batch Slice/Strip/Interleave).
- **feat:** added progress bar support (`comfy.utils.ProgressBar`) inside the workflow migration execute loops.
- **feat:** added floating close button in DOM Preview single image mode to return to grid layout.
- **feat:** updated repository reset scripts under `scripts/` to include safety confirmation prompts and preserve `config.json` option.
- **fix:** resolved a PIL data type `TypeError: Cannot handle this data type: (1, 1, 832, 3)` in `Preview Image (DOM)` (`RvImage_PreviewDom.py`) by implementing robust list/batch flattening and squeezing logic.
- **fix:** updated `Save Images [Eclipse]` (`RvImage_Save.py`) to declare `is_input_list=True` and `is_output_list=True` on outputs, wrapping single output elements into lists to resolve downstream list compatibility issues.
- **fix:** resolved a list nesting bug in `Save Images [Eclipse]` (`RvImage_Save.py`) where returning single-element lists wrapped the output tensor in a nested list `[[tensor]]`, causing downstream SaveImage nodes to fail.
- **fix:** resolved execution crashes and schema mapping issues for list connections on Image Selector, Image Comparer, Save Images, Mask to SEGS, and the Stop node.
- **fix:** resolved a frontend configuration bug in Seed node where clicking "New Fixed Random" or randomizing generated a 64-bit seed value when in 32-bit mode.
- **fix:** resolved image display inside Image Selector's One Image per Row mode to calculate dynamic cell heights based on natural aspect ratios.
- **docs:** added descriptive parameter tooltips with recommended values for advanced photographic parameters to ensure ease of use.
- **chore:** completely removed all hardcoded static fallback node name mappings from the Python codebase, relying fully on loading external configuration files.
- **chore:** renamed `RvImage_Preview_Mask` to `RvMask_Preview` and moved it under a new Mask node category.
- **chore:** reorganized all `RvImage_` nodes into Loaders, Save & Preview, Batch Operations, Transforms, and FX & Color subcategory menus.
- **chore:** renamed video nodes starting with `RvImage_` to start with `RvVideo_`.
- **chore:** complete removal of all deprecated legacy nodes, legacy files, and registry imports for the v4.0.0 cleanup.
- **BREAKING:** removed all deprecated legacy nodes, breaking older saved workflows using legacy nodes.
- **BREAKING:** removed compatibility configurations and output connection checks for the rgthree-comfy node pack.
- **BREAKING:** combined Seed and Seed 32-bit nodes into one using a bit_depth combo selector (defaulting to 64-bit).
- **BREAKING:** removed Lora Stack to String node from the codebase.
- **BREAKING:** removed VRAM CleanUp custom node and JS helper.
- **BREAKING:** removed old v21 and v22 Pipe IO Sampler Settings nodes, renamed v23 to Pipe IO Sampler Settings, and removed `prompt_seed`, `upscale_steps`, and `upscale_denoise` options.
- **BREAKING:** removed deprecated Pipe Out VC Name Generator node.
- **BREAKING:** removed Sampler Selection and Custom Size nodes.
- **BREAKING:** removed RAM Cleanup node.
- **BREAKING:** removed version tag suffixes from active node IDs: Smart Model Loader v2 [Eclipse] -> Smart Model Loader [Eclipse], IO Checkpoint Loader v2 [Eclipse] -> IO Checkpoint Loader [Eclipse], Smart Folder v2 [Eclipse] -> Smart Folder [Eclipse], and Save Images v2 [Eclipse] -> Save Images [Eclipse].
