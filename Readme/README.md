   - Reduce VRAM usage significantly
   - Understand GPU compatibility
   - Optimize for your hardware

### Quick Help

**I want to...**

- **Load a basic model** → [Checkpoint Loader Small](Checkpoint_Loaders.md#checkpoint-loader-small)
- **Save/load configurations** → [Template System](Smart_Loaders.md#template-system)
- **Use quantized models** → [Model Types & Formats](Smart_Loaders.md#model-types--formats)
- **Reduce VRAM usage** → [Quantization Configuration](Smart_Loaders.md#quantization-configuration)
- **Build CLIP ensembles** → [CLIP Configuration](Smart_Loaders.md#clip-configuration)
- **Work with pipes** → [Checkpoint Loader Small (Pipe)](Checkpoint_Loaders.md#checkpoint-loader-small-pipe)
- **Build prompts from files** → [Smart Prompt Guide](Smart_Prompt.md)
- **Create prompt templates** → [Wildcard Processor Guide](Wildcard_Processor.md)
- **Install Nunchaku support** → [Nunchaku Installation](Nunchaku_Installation.md)
- **Reduce VRAM with quantization** → [Nunchaku Installation](Nunchaku_Installation.md)

### Common Questions

**Q: Which loader should I use?**

A: Start with **Checkpoint Loader Small** for simplicity. Move to **Smart Loader Plus** when you need:
- Multiple model formats (UNet, Nunchaku, GGUF)
- Template management for quick switching
- Quantized models for VRAM savings
- All-in-one latent and sampler configuration

**Q: What's the difference between Smart Loader and Smart Loader Plus?**

A: **Smart Loader Plus** includes latent and sampler configuration built-in. **Smart Loader** is the streamlined version without those - you use separate Empty Latent and KSampler nodes instead.

**Q: How do I reduce VRAM usage?**

A: Use quantized models (Nunchaku or GGUF) with Smart Loaders. See [Quantization Configuration](Smart_Loaders.md#quantization-configuration) for details.

**Q: What are templates?**

A: Templates save your complete loader configuration (model, CLIP, VAE, sampler, etc.) so you can restore it instantly later. See [Template System](Smart_Loaders.md#template-system).

**Q: My checkpoint won't load, what do I do?**

A: Check the [Troubleshooting](Checkpoint_Loaders.md#troubleshooting) sections in both guides for solutions to common problems.

**Q: How do I build prompts quickly?**

A: Use [Smart Prompt](Smart_Prompt.md) for dropdown-based selection from organized prompt files, or [Wildcard Processor](Wildcard_Processor.md) for template-based generation with infinite variations.

**Q: What's the difference between Smart Prompt and Wildcard Processor?**

A: **Smart Prompt** uses numbered text files to create dropdown menus (select from curated options). **Wildcard Processor** uses template syntax like `{option1|option2}` for dynamic expansion (infinite variations from templates).

**Q: How do I install Nunchaku for quantized models?**

A: Follow the detailed [Nunchaku Installation Guide](Nunchaku_Installation.md). It includes step-by-step commands for ComfyUI Portable, dependency management, and GPU compatibility information.

**Q: What GPU do I need for Nunchaku/quantized models?**

A: RTX 30 and 40 series GPUs work well with the primary benefit being lower VRAM usage. RTX 50 series (Blackwell) will add native FP4 acceleration for additional speed. See [GPU Compatibility](Nunchaku_Installation.md#gpu-compatibility) for details.

### Recommended File Formats

| Format | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `.safetensors` | ✅ Recommended | Safe, fast, modern |
| `.sft` | ✅ Recommended | Safetensors alternative |
| `.ckpt` | ⚠️ Legacy | Works but shows warning |
| `.pt` | ⚠️ Legacy | Works but shows warning |
| `.pth` | ⚠️ Legacy | Works but shows warning |

Always prefer `.safetensors` when available for safety and speed.
